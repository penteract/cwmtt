A program for analysing games of 5D chess

Can be built with the Haskell tool Stack [https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/] by running `stack build`.
It should also be possible to build it just using Cabal.

`stack exec cwmtt` will run the program if built using Stack.

At the moment, the game is presented via a cli, giving you a list of available moves then prompts you to enter a number to indicate which move to play.
